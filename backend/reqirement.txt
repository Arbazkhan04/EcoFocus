when the company is promoted to agency
company A ---> before promoting to agency
company A --> Admins[kahn,abc]
company A --> users[k,sdk]

when it is promoted
after promoting to agency
company data will be the company data right. but if user or company is trying to invite anybody they can't 
the user will be added to the agency. Company A cant invite or recive invite from other users.
the invite will goes to agency


second scanrio 
if i create an company inside the agency or i request connection with the agency.
But i can be promoted into the agency as well right?

when i promoted to agency and is trying to add any user into my commpany they will keep the data separate.





CONTRAINT RULE
IF THE COMPANY IS CONNECTED WITH THE AGENCY OR UNDER THE AGENCY THE COMPANY CAN ONLY BE MANAGED BY THE AGENCY
COMPANY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RECIVE NOTIFICATION OR CAN NOT ADD ANY PERSON INTO THE COMPANY IT CAN ONLY BE DONE
BY AGENCY ADMIN OR AGENCY CONTACT PERSON. AND AGENCY WILL ASSIGN USER TO THE COMPANY. AND WE WILL PUSH THESE THING
INTO THE AGENCY.
IF THE AGENCY ASSIGN ANY USER INTO THE COMPANY THE USER WILL GOES INTO THE THE COMPANY AND WE WILL LINK WITH
AGENCY SO IN THE WAY WE CAN EASILY DETERMINE THIS COMPANY IS UNDER THIS AGENCY AND HAS BEEN MANAGED BY THESE
USERS AND ADMINS.






1) company can not invite the agency for the conection see the screen shot.
I am talking about the infomation page where company can request connection with the agency. Only it can be promoted into agency.
2) If the company is created under the agency then this company can not be promoted into the agency

1) Answer 
Becuase when the company is created There are the possiblites it may contain some data already.
we somehow need a connection bw company and agency.
I think in this case what we can do is that we only link the company with the agency without touching the existing 
company struture right.

2) This can also be promoted into agency becuase see we are only linking the company to agency and we are not
storing any kind of data in the agency. we are just linking.



company can be connected with multiple agency?
No. a company can be connected with one agency.
